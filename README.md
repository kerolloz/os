# Operating System Tasks

## Create A Simple Linux Shell

The shell takes user input, parse it, fork() & exec(user input) & print_the_output() and so on...

## Increment Using Threads (Mutex lock)

You have 5 threads, each thread should run a function that loops from 1 to 10^8 in each step the function
should increment a global variable, the value of the variable should equal to 5 \* 10^8

## Usage

- clone the repo
- run `make` command in your terminal to compile all the files
- `./shell` to run the shell program
- `./sum` to run the sum program
